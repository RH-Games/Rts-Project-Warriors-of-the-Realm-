# Rts-Project-Warriors-of-the-Realm-
Real-Time Strategy Project
For this project, I will be using asset packs from Synty Stuido for models. This is so I can focus on the programming and game design side of the project.
I am the solo developer on this project. I am a massive fan of RTS games and wanted to make one myself.

## Game Concept

Warriors of the Realm is a real-time strategy game where the player can take control of 3 factions Knights Orcs and Vikings. The aim is to have a working single-player sandbox mode where the player can fight 1 or two other factions on a map level.

### Game Loop

The game loop is to create a small base by gathering resources and then recruit units to explore and fight for the land. The goal for the player is to defeat the other factions on the level to win by either conquest or gather all Crystal resources.

### Combat Loop

The combat in the game is based on rock, paper, scissors.
-Sword and shield: Wins against Archery, loses against Heavy weapon
-Archery: Beats Heavy weapons, losers against Sword and shield
-Heavy weapon: Wins against Sword and shield, Losers against Archery
